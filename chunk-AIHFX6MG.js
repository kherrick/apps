<p>In the past year, I bought a 2004 Toyota Corolla and one of the problems that it had when I bought it was that the clock was not working. After some quick research, I discovered that the solution may not be all that difficult. I will give credit to the YouTube video that I found addressing this solution <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfGE4AeTQCE" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfGE4AeTQCE">here</a>. Anyways, I took the clock out and took the assembly apart. There is only one Phillips screw that needs removed behind the fan speed selector knob. Then the whole assembly just pops out. I used a flat head screwdriver to take the clock out, and then to remove the backing. What we are looking for is the 5 resistors on the back of the circuit board that I have circled below.</p>

<p>In order to fix the clock, I simply re-soldered these resistors to the board. Upon reinstalling the clock in the car, it lit right up. This job only took me about a half hour, and it has been working since. As far as car work goes, this has been the simplest and most satisfactory job I have done yet. I never knew how much joy the lighting of this little green clock could bring me.</p>

<p>I recently was able to pick up a used Dewalt cordless drill for $20. I was very happy with my purchase until I got home and realized with some use that the motor was mostly burnt out and that the brushes were on their way out. The motor made a decent bit of what I would call, burning smell. I looked into replacing the brushes and found very limited information about that specific model, DCD771. After taking it apart, I realized that the motor was pressure fitted together and would be quite a lot of work. The brushes ended up being $15 on Amazon or I could buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motor-N376649-DCD776-cordless-driver/dp/B09D3P9MQC?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.h6argMvjNpj-_KFNXqi5ZvKzGEnplU13fdyxZUZrynO3D86y5cNalex4RGT1fBzgDfSkuxDGg2S1MuAaTy4tOKbit3V3t4m0mee3IbLEoKCd-pQEkxSsOh61-0IVoOWDyW6bQPwCOE941c6-4vlWH7pfyzqQ3_v781f9pR-YAGV5yVmkmRhEOJhc8dx17V6IAKV7_Cm2R0GrAKMo5W-9rrpHxoXQtMj0ikcPoSijUSFNjM5dESGNiEV9_exctvw6UE6BkxFe_hrNZpb3hu4FZkKl9DbY1xteAogfyxDLyEuEIjD9iLBUe1FqUj1ec1dLhcoQGlIdJUqXgt9GjjCtMZiriS2Vm7jQeNIov_vl7gJdno4RHNa9UX-7B5urcxED4yf7UtjGOvAMb5jJDJDXWFBv9QWdb98nD7xHEGPrhvalUvY1O_1Z4w_zdkKyG6PD.jk0jJB1FYFIvZ4rSVOw4kAhkuluaoIsWTq-8VBdbjNA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=dewalt+drill+dcd771+motor+replacement&amp;qid=1740288318&amp;sr=8-3" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.amazon.com/Motor-N376649-DCD776-cordless-driver/dp/B09D3P9MQC?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.h6argMvjNpj-_KFNXqi5ZvKzGEnplU13fdyxZUZrynO3D86y5cNalex4RGT1fBzgDfSkuxDGg2S1MuAaTy4tOKbit3V3t4m0mee3IbLEoKCd-pQEkxSsOh61-0IVoOWDyW6bQPwCOE941c6-4vlWH7pfyzqQ3_v781f9pR-YAGV5yVmkmRhEOJhc8dx17V6IAKV7_Cm2R0GrAKMo5W-9rrpHxoXQtMj0ikcPoSijUSFNjM5dESGNiEV9_exctvw6UE6BkxFe_hrNZpb3hu4FZkKl9DbY1xteAogfyxDLyEuEIjD9iLBUe1FqUj1ec1dLhcoQGlIdJUqXgt9GjjCtMZiriS2Vm7jQeNIov_vl7gJdno4RHNa9UX-7B5urcxED4yf7UtjGOvAMb5jJDJDXWFBv9QWdb98nD7xHEGPrhvalUvY1O_1Z4w_zdkKyG6PD.jk0jJB1FYFIvZ4rSVOw4kAhkuluaoIsWTq-8VBdbjNA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=dewalt+drill+dcd771+motor+replacement&amp;qid=1740288318&amp;sr=8-3">new motor for $30</a>.

<p>I ended up having to do some work, but a Dewalt drill for $50 is not a bad deal. It was fun seeing the inside of the drill, and the Amazon part was just as expected.</p>

<p>I recently purchased a vehicle made in the early 2000s and it only has a CD player.

<p>This would require replacing the car&#8217;s head unit. For the sake of simplicity, security, and affordability, I opted to give a try using a Bluetooth FM transmitter that operates out of a cigarette lighter outlet.</p>

<p>I found it really easy to use but sometimes, where there are more towers broadcasting, the FM transmitter can get overpowered. It has the ability to broadcast on different channels which allows for you to work around that problem. I would not recommend it for those who want really high quality, static free music, but for my needs with my cheap car speakers, it is quite handy.</p>

It has little built in speakers that, while they&#8217;re no subwoofer, do capture some of the bass from the records. What&#8217;s more is that it can act as a Bluetooth speaker if you want, although I don&#8217;t know why you would play music from your device when you have records. Anyways, I have definitely been enjoying the portability and ease of use with my new record player.</p>

<p>Although the images generated can be quite chaotic or unrealistic at times, when given the right prompt, these generators can produce interesting and fun images. There are so many key words that they pick up on like styling photos to be photo-realistic, classic, impressionist, hand-drawn, ect. You can pick what ever they draw and add elements like a graffiti or floral look. It is not only a lot of fun, but can be useful when trying to come up with specific images. Here are a couple fun examples that were generated with Bard.</p>

<p>I recently received a few extra bikes from a friend and decided to try making a tall bike from one of the frames. It is basically just an upside-down bike since I just flipped the frame. The seat post and handle bars needed to be longer since the pedals were so much higher. It took a bit of welding and some work getting the chain tensioned without the derailleur. It&#8217;s functional, but also a bit scary being so far from the ground. In the future, I would make the bend for the handle bars closer to the frame, as it is a bit awkward to steer.</p>

<p>We bought a decent pedestal fan a couple years back and it randomly died recently. It still didn&#8217;t work after cleaning it so, I decided to try bypassing the thermal fuse. It worked, but I couldn&#8217;t leave it that way with any peace of mind. After using a magnifying glass to read the small print, I bought a couple new fuses online.</p>

<p>I soldered a new one on, but I got it too hot from the soldering iron. I did it again and left more room between the fuse and the solder point. It works great now, and it just took a cheap little fuse to fix!</p>

<p>My bike recently started to develop a wobble on the back wheel. I realised that it was due to the bearings failing, so I decided to take it apart and try to fix it. I found another rear wheel that had been bent, so I had some spare parts to use.</p>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Once I pulled the gears off, there was this piece with bearings on it. I counted and there were 88 bearings in total. There are 9 bearings on each side of the axle. There are then 39 bearings around this piece in the picture, and then 31 that go on the gear piece.</p>

<p>The hardest part was making sure that there was the proper amount of bearings in each part. Once I got it all back together, it worked great, and it no longer had the wobble because I replaced the broken part.</p>

<p>Since it takes 4 C batteries I got a 6V power supply. I measured the voltage from the supply and found it was outputting 7 something volts! I found out that when &#8220;cheap&#8221; power supplies are not under load, they can have a higher than expected voltage. I was a bit nervous the first time I plugged it in, but it worked great. It is much better than the alternatives and I have enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>After fixing the mess of wires, I tested it out by battery. It worked but the audio cut in and out when at full volume. I found out that one of the wires was getting pinched and after fixing that it plays great. I would like to get a 6V DC power supply instead of burning C batteries, but I have really enjoyed getting this vintage cassette recorder working.</p>
