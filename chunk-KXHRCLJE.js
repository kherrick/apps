<p>The <a href="https://www.pembina.ca/m/darlingford/darlingford-school-heritage-museum">Darlingford School Heritage Museum</a>, constructed in 1910 as a school, was designed with provisions for a southern expansion that never materialized. It operated until 1984, received provincial heritage designation in 1987, and reopened as a community museum. The facility adopted its current name, Darlingford Pembina Heritage Museum, in 2023.</p>

<cite>Proverbs 16:9</cite></blockquote>



<p></p>



<p>Back in the 1990s as a kid, ringing in the new year meant changing the date written in the top right corner of school assignments. Now deep into the 21st century, the world has changed in countless ways, but one anchor holds firm. God&#8217;s Word endures as that unchanging truth, no matter the future or man&#8217;s plans for it.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Commit your works to the Lord [submit and trust them to Him], And your plans will succeed [if you respond to His will and guidance].</p>
