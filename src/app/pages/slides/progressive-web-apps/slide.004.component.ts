              >Mobile first, a form of progressive enhancement, is a
              web-development and web-design approach that focuses on
              prioritizing design and development for mobile screen sizes over
              design and development for desktop screen sizes. The rationale
              behind the mobile-first approach is to provide users with good
              user experiences at all screen sizesâ€”by starting with creating a
              user experience that works well on small screens, and then
              building on top of that to further enrich the user experience as
              the screen size increases. The mobile-first approach contrasts
              with the older approach of designing for desktop screen sizes
              first, and then only later adding some support for small screen
              sizes.</span
