<p>A few facts&#8230; Moose are shy, solitary animals, and don\u2019t travel in packs. They can live for up to 25 years, and prefer cold climates, like Manitoba. Apparently moose can outrun a person by the time they\u2019re 5 days old, traveling up to 56 km/h (35 mph). Yikes! Don&#8217;t get too close.</p>

<p>I tend to be a &#8220;home body&#8221;, so my job has forced me to put on my boots and go see the view from the top of the valley when it&#8217;s too cold to want to venture out. That has also meant that I have seen new beautiful views, for which I&#8217;m often reaching for my camera. I hope to share a variety of pictures with you from behind the wheel, today and in the future.</p>
